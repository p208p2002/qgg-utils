Hi, friends! Welcome to our Family Rock Band. There are four members in our band. They are Wangwang, Mimi, Yingying and I. Wangwang is my dog. It can sing and dance. Mimi is my cat. It can't dance but it can sing and do Chinese kung fu. Yingying is a parrot . It can sing very well. I can play the guitar. When I play the guitar, they sing and dance. We have a show in our home every Sunday evening. Many boys and girls come to my show. They like it very much.
